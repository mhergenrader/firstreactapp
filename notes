- don't really need to worry too much about index.html - just a template, and
  most everything in React is done

- npm test = keeps an auto watch as well! cool!

- can start mocking up static version of how to render in just JSX

- there is an available defaultChecked property available

rendered view should be function of app state (functional)
want state to be in sync w/ view; this is accomplished via previous line


create-react-app comes w/ jest for testing, so can build items in test-driven
style
- note here that we wrote a test first and then wrote the code after to make
  the test pass: TDD
- and tests effectively serve as a more detailed contract of pre- and post-
  conditions - they define the contract and high-level behavior of what we
  should expect from certain things that we put under test
  - the code itself can do some error checking, etc. (and tests should try
    to potentially hit that), but tests should test the intended behaviors as 
    well
    - and in TDD, we can determine these constraints and possible error
      conditions ahead of time to then give us the ability to do proper error
      checking in the code right away w/o much thought! that is, we can think
      of the general contract and constraints for something to test and then the
      code just implements what should be done in addition to just implementing
      those constraints and how it should behave! test-first helps us design our
      functions, etc. directly! (in an unbiased way because we are stating
      upfront via tests first exactly how this function, etc. should act)
- also good to do TDD because then if we change things, we can either set up
  the latest assumptions in our tests and have essentially a checklist of what
  new things to apply to our function under test or we can implement changes
  and then see any existing tests/assertions fail (former is likely better)
  - corollary: gives you confidence in refactoring that when you change
    something and tests still pass, you have a valid replacement (or can have
    decent confidence, assuming you have comprehensive enough tests)
- Arrange, Act, Assert as the unit test setup (pretty self-explanatory)

TODO:
- look at the reexport setup of index.js in components/todo
