- don't really need to worry too much about index.html - just a template, and
  most everything in React is done

- npm test = keeps an auto watch as well! cool!

- can start mocking up static version of how to render in just JSX

- there is an available defaultChecked property available

rendered view should be function of app state (functional)
want state to be in sync w/ view; this is accomplished via previous line


TODO:
- look at the reexport setup of index.js in components/todo
